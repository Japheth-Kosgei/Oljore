# Oljore
Climatic analysis tools for architects and designers

One of the characteristics of architects is their love for infographics. This project is meant to assist architects and designers to visualize climatic data and derive insights for use in design of climatic responsive buildings.

"Oljore" is a African word for "friend". As the name suggest, this project is meant to be friend of an architect.

## Areas of interest
- Accomodation Schedules.
- Case studies.
- Climatic analysis.

## Objectives
### Accomodation Schedule
- Provide a user experience for creating and editing accomodation schedules and presenting/printing them.
- Include a feature of calculating space areas and giving a statistical report/chart.

### Case studies
- Enable the architect to produce a location map of the building being studied.
- Do a climatic analysis of that location.

### Climatic analysis
- Enable the architect to find and download weather data suitable for any place on the planet using a map.
- Parse the data into a meaningful format/frame for analysis.
- Analyse the data based on comfort scales i.e. psychrometric chart and bioclimatic chart.
- Provide insights for the architect to use using Mahoney tables.
- Design and automatically produce graphs and charts.
- Prepare printable beautiful dashboards which can be easily consumed by the architect. The dashboards should contain the charts and the analysis.
